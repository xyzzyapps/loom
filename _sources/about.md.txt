# Loom

Sumbission for langjam#0001

While the inital goal was to build something like docco, later I realised I could do something like an animation inside comments using a dsl. The code rendering time is surprisingly long which I had not anticipated. There is also an options that will strip code and store comment sequences inside a sqlite for fun and it is used to explore a new metric of code quality - lines of comment / lines of code.

first-class comments (interpretation): treat comment sequences as a value that can be freely passed, stored ... like python dictionaries + pickle or intergers. A comment sequence is something seprated by 0-width indentaition of  codeblocks.

Examples include - hello-world and fibonacci

```{todo}
Explore if this is feasible for larger pre-existing codebases.
```

# Is this a quine ?

# Instructions

```sh
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python loom.py test.py
```

Additional utilities for animation,

```
brew install cowsay
npm install -g terminalizer 
```

```
python source/loom.py --generate-docs fibonacci build1
python source/loom.py --comment-stats
python loom.py --generate-terminal-show fibonacci
```
